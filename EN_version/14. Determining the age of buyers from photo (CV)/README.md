**Project description:**

A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group and control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol. A model is being built that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people with age indication.
