## Industry. Temperature Prediction in Steel Melting

***Fields of activity:*** Business, industry.

***Line of business:*** Machine learning, regression, analyst.

***Skills and tools:*** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, LightGBM.

***Project objective:*** In order to optimize production costs, the smelter decided to reduce electricity consumption during the steel processing stage. It is necessary to build a model that will predict the final steel temperature.

***Project description:*** Using machine learning, it is necessary to predict the final temperature of the steel during melting and adding various additives to adjust the chemical composition of the steel. Process:

Steel is processed in a metal ladle with a capacity of about 100 tons. Molten steel is poured into a ladle and heated to the desired temperature with graphite electrodes. They are installed in the lid of the bucket.
Sulfur is removed from the alloy (desulfurization), the chemical composition is corrected by adding impurities, and samples are taken. Steel is alloyed - its composition is changed - by feeding pieces of alloy from a bunker for bulk materials or wire through a special tribe apparatus.
Before introducing alloying additives for the first time, the temperature of the steel is measured and its chemical analysis is carried out. Then the temperature is raised for several minutes, alloying materials are added and the alloy is purged with an inert gas. Then it is stirred and measured again. This cycle is repeated until the target chemical composition and optimum melting temperature are reached.
