## Study of the technological process of gold refining

**Fields of activity:** industry.

**Line of business:** Machine learning, analyst (universal).

**Skills and Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Project objective:** Predict the concentration of gold during the gold refining process.

**Project description:** A machine learning model is being built for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

**Project keywords:** data analysis, regression, custom quality metrics.
