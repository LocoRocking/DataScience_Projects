# DataScience_Projects

My projects with training on the course Data Science Specialist at Yandex Practicum.

During the development period, 15 projects were implemented using real data.

## 1. A study of Yandex.Music service data is a comparison of users of two cities.

***Fields of activity:*** internet services, streaming service, music.

***Line of business:*** Data Analyst.

***Skills and tools:*** Python, Pandas.

***Project goal:*** Based on real Yandex.Music data using the Pandas library and its capabilities to check the data and compare the behavior and preferences of users in the two capitals â€” Moscow and St. Petersburg.

***Description of the project:***

Comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths:
- Moscow is a metropolis subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
- Petersburg is a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow.
Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Business must distinguish the former from the latter in order to make rational decisions. Let's check the data using real data from Yandex.Music and compare the behavior of users in the two capitals.
